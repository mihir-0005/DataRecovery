This is a file recovery tool which makes use of python.

Script Components
Recovery_Script.py: The main Python script containing the logic and comments for easy implementation.
Run_me.bat: A batch file that automates the process by checking for Python installation, installing it if necessary, and executing the Python script.

How it Works
The script bypasses the file system and directly accesses the raw bits of data on the drive. It scans the drive for files matching specific signatures and restores them. Since it doesn't rely on the file system, it cannot recover files to specific folders, as folders are simply indexing values assigned to blocks of data by the file system.

Configuration
To use the script, the user needs to update the drive letter in the Recovery_Script.py file. All recovered files will be written to a folder named "recovered".
